# CSS Filter Blur Issue with Fixed Positioning

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `filter: blur()` CSS property on elements with `position: fixed;`.  The blur effect may not apply correctly or might produce unexpected results.

## Problem
The `filter: blur()` property is applied to a fixed positioned element, yet the blur is not visible or appears incorrectly. This often happens when z-indexing and stacking contexts interact in unexpected ways with fixed elements and the filter. 

## Solution
The solution might involve adjusting z-index values, ensuring proper stacking contexts, using a wrapper element, or checking for conflicting CSS rules that might override the blur effect.  See `bugSolution.css` for a potential solution.
